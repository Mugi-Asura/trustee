# Updates

**v1.0.0** is the current version.

## Potential Future Updates

1. **Fix the command function code.** It's quite monolithic right now. I started breaking things down into functions, but decided to post this functional version as a starting point.
2. **Add some colours to the addon output.** It's currently all white and that makes it difficult to read. I'll probably colour-code different labels and outputs to make it easier to know when the addon is pushing information to the user.
3. **Better (any) algorithmic efficiency.** I mostly coded things that worked rather than things that were fast. However, it's FFXI and I doubt the game is stressing anyone's computer enough that my O(n<sup>2</sup>) search algorithms over ~200 elements are destroying their performance.
